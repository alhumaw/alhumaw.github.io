I guess reversing deserved a challenge after all.

## Solution

This zip file contains two RAID metadata files. I was unsure what could be done with these until I came across this [post](https://blog.bi0s.in/2020/02/09/Forensics/RR-HackTM/)
Using this knowledge, I XOR'd the two images together to form one recovered image. I then binwalked the file which contained a linux filesystem:

I extracted the file system, then ran strings on it to display the entire file system:

Once I was able to see the file system, I came to the conclusion that we could likely just extract the files from this filesystem utilizing the hex dump and the "dd" command.
Knowing this, I found the location of a PNG header signature inside the hex dump, converted it's hex location to decimal, then extracted the PNG file:
